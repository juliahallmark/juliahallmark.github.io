My name is Julia and I love books. After working for over 13 years as a preschool teacher, I can also honestly say that I love children. Now that I have retired from teaching, I have decided to write out the stories I used to tell children on the playground into books. My first book is called The Chase and it is a book about standing up to bullies and the possible consequences of bullying. It is semi-biographical in that the Chase itself actually took place led by a cat, followed by our two dogs and my husband and me. It was a hilarious race when it happened and is even more fun as a rush for justice in the book.

I have partnered with Christian Faith Publishers in this endeavor. Their gifted illustrators and editors have been extremely helpful. I believe that the children in your life will be delighted and amused by the story.
