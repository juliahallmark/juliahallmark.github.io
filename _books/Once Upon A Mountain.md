What happens when God chooses an unremarkable family to become missionaries to alien civilizations?

Nine-year-old Jenna and her father, Brian, are hiking on Mount Diablo when they are pulled through interdimensional doorways across time and space and into alien worlds, forcing Lisa, Brian's wife and Jenna's mother, to solve the mystery of her vanishing family. In this first book of the four-book series, Jenna finds herself dropped into a world populated by Sasquatch or, as they call themselves, Sasqui. Jenna is the unwanted answer to their desperate prayers. Her presence and that of her God will shake the Sasqui civilization down to its foundations. As she struggles to adapt to her new life among these volatile beings, Jenna will be proof of the proverb "Be careful what you ask for, you just might get it."
