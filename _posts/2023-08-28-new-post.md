Hi Dear readers,

As I draw closer to finishing this round of editing, (shout out to Christian Faith Publishers!) I've been exploring the wonderful world of line editing, let me explain. Did you know that the editors of a publishing company will number every line of text and space in a manuscript? Yup, every single line!

The first view of a line numbered manuscript for a newbie author, such as myself, can be a bit intimidating. But then one realizes what a God send it is for both the author and the editor(s) during the manuscript refining process. Because each line that needs correction or rewriting is referenced by its own number. Therefore finding, communicating, and making the needed changes is a streamlined breeze! Isn't that amazing?

Well bye-bye for now!
