*Exciting news!* My first full novel is currently in the final editing stages with Christian Faith publishers, my publisher! *Once Upon a Mountain* is the first novel in my four installment Christian science fiction series. This series will follow the adventures of the members of the Di Paula family when God sends them out to be missionaries, and to answer the prayers of. two separate alien civilizations. Please look under my adult/ young adult bubble for a further description of this novel. I will be providing further updates regarding it's cover and release dates as soon as I have them!
